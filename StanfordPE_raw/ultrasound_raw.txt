	    Introduction to Bedside Ultrasound
	    
    

  
  
  
 














     

The portability and availability of ultrasound is rapidly advancing bedside examination in places like the emergency room, where the FAST (Focused Assessment Sonography in Trauma) exam is becoming the standard of care. Bedside, or point of care, ultrasound has not yet become standardized for internists, but its utility cannot be ignored. We believe that teaching bedside ultrasound to the next generation of internists has the potential to standardize its use while bringing the internist back to the bedside.

Bedside ultrasound is not a replacement for sonographic studies performed by radiologists or cardiologists. Bedside ultrasound should be used to answer specific questions in real time. An example is the increasingly common use of bedside ultrasound by intensivists to estimate left ventricular function, an estimation not easily assessed by other physical exam maneuvers. The intensivist is able to answer a specific question in a timely fashion without ordering a complete echocardiogram. As bedside ultrasound is becoming more common it will be important that we educate patients to this difference, lest patients misunderstand the exams that are performed.

Currently there is no one clear model for teaching bedside ultrasound, with different institutions across the world creating their own approaches. We anticipate a steep learning curve especially when practicing on healthy patients. Sick patients, on the other hand, represent greater challenges and we feel that it will be important for residents to learn at both levels.

    Welcome to a Stanford Medicine 25 video on introduction to the ultrasounds.

Hi, my name is Dr. John Kugler and this is the introduction to point of care for bedside ultrasounds as part of the Stanford 25 series. Today, our goal will be for you to learn how to use the ultrasound machines we have available here which is going to be the Sonosite Model S and Sonosite M-Turbo. Our goal will be for you to learn how to correctly choose a probe depending on which exam you're doing and how to use the, what we call, knobology - to use the buttons that are available on the machines to give you the best possible exam you can.

All right let's get started with choosing a probe. The first probe that I'm going to show you here is called the linear probe.  This is going to be the probe you want to reach for if you're doing procedures. The reason for that is it has high frequency ultrasound beams which don't give you a lot of depth. You can only go as deep as six centimeters into the body - but it gives you very very high resolution to see fine structures so when you're looking for veins for the central venous line catheter this is the probe that you want to use.

What you do need to know about it is that it does have a probe indicator on the side that will correspond to the dot on the screen there and that'll let you know what your orientation is. The next program I want to show you is what's referred to as the abdominal probe. This is what many people refer to it as or the curvilinear probe (its technical name). ​

​This is going to give you a much broader depth of field because it has a very wide footprint and it has very low frequency ultrasound beams which gives you a lot of depth so you can see up to 30 centimeters into the body. This is going to be a great probe if you want to look at the liver, if you want to look at the kidneys, or if you want to look at other structures in the abdomen.

The last probe that we use in internal medicine is this probe which is a phased array probe or other people refer to it as the cardiac probe. The reason we call it that is because it's really good at doing a target echocardiography. The reason for that is it has a small footprint. This allows the ultrasound beam to effectively go between the ribs and to give you a view of the heart without any rib shadow. This is a great probe for doing echo. You can also look into the abdomen with it as well but it's going to give you a smaller field than the curvilinear probe. It's also excellent for assessing sizes of pleural effusions because again you can look between the ribs to assess the size.

Once you've chosen the probe you need to make sure you know how to attach it correctly. Right now the linear probe is in place and if we want to switch that out for the cardiac probe you're going to lift up this bar here on the back of the machine. I'm going to twist it. It comes right out - very simple. ​

T​ake our new probe and we'll place it in like this twist and we lock it into place and that's all.

The Sonosite Model S machine is available on Ward b3 in room 9. This is the on/off button - very straightforward. P​lug the machine in and hit the button to turn it on. It actually has a battery so you don't always need to plug it in. In terms of the buttons you need to be familiar with let's just start with auto gain. ​

T​his button is actually very useful - once you plug the probe in this will essentially be working. You may need to adjust the gain manually down here but usually just hitting the auto gain will reset it and give you good quality. The gain down here will essentially make the screen more white. It amplifies the signal. Sometimes you do need to do it manually. Adjust this in order to make the image as clear as possible.

The other button you're going to need to know really well is depth. T​his is oneyou'll probably need to adjust for every patient. This essentially gives you more depth as you rotate it and you can see the numbers going up here in the corner. These are set to centimeters. Essentially you want to make sure that what you're most interested in what you're focusing on is all essentially in the middle of the screen. That's going to give you the best resolution.

You want to adjust your depth so your image falls in that area. The other buttons you should be familiar with here are freeze-frame. S​o if you're looking at something and you want to take a measurement you can hit the freeze button in order to do measurements and the Save button if you want to save a loop to review t​hat later.  Really with just these few buttons you should be able to take care of almost everything you'll need to do.

The Sonosite M-turbo is the machine that you'll find in the ICU and in the ER here at Stanford. For this machine, you'll find the on/off button right here. I​t opens like a laptop and then just to review the same buttons as we saw on the Model S. You're going to find the auto gain button here and then this is your manual gain control here on the corner. A​gain if we want to turn this up we'll see that we're going to increase the signal and will do less signal the other buttons. Again you should know about the depth button, instead of a dial. Y​ou actually have a button so I want to give a greater depth of field. Again, I just press down and it gets deeper and this takes it the other way. If I want to freeze it has a nice big freeze button that I can hit and then if I want to start it again I just hit the freeze button again. H​ere is your Save button over here on the corner. Again very easily marked.

This has been another Stanford 25 Medicine presentation.

    Ultrasound probes come in many different types and for our purposes we should be familiar with three different types.

  
  
 













    




































    
        
    
    



    
        
        
        
    
    




    
    
    
    
    
        
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    







    
        
            
            
                
                    






                

            
        
    

    
        Linear Probe

A linear probe uses high frequency ultrasound to create high resolution images of structures near the body surface. This makes the probe ideal for vascular imaging and certain procedures such as central line placement.


        
    
















    




































    
        
    
    



    
        
        
        
    
    




    
    
    
    
    
        
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    







    
        
            
            
                
                    






                

            
        
    

    
        Curvilinear Probe

A curvilinear probe uses lower frequency ultrasound allowing a deep penetration and a wide depth of field, which is excellent for viewing intra-abdominal structures.


        
    
















    




































    
        
    
    



    
        
        
        
    
    




    
    
    
    
    
        
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    







    
        
            
            
                
                    






                

            
        
    

    
        Phased Array Probe

Phased array probes give a large depth of field with a small footprint allowing the ultrasound to view deep structures though a small acoustic window. This makes it the ideal probe for viewing structure in the chest as the ultrasound waves are beamed between the ribs.
