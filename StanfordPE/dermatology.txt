The General Dermatology Exam: Learning the Language

The diagnosis of any skin lesion starts with an accurate description of it. To do that, you need to know how to describe a lesion with the associated language. This language, reviewed here, can be used to describe any skin finding.

Approach to General Exam

Approach to Multiple Rashes

Introduction to the Dermatology Exam

Before you can make a diagnosis of any skin lesion, it's important to be able to accurately describe the skin lesion. The purpose of this page is to cover the fundamental knowledge you will need to do this.

Learn the Language of the Dermatology Exam

Primary Morphology	Macule - flat lesion less than 1 cm, without elevation or depression

Patch - flat lesion greater than 1 cm, without elevation or depression

Plaque - flat, elevated lesion, usually greater than 1 cm

Papule - elevated, solid lesion less than 1 cm

Nodule - elevated, solid lesion greater than 1 cm

Vesicle - elevated, fluid-filled lesion, usually less than 1 cm

Pustule - elevated, pus-filled lesion, usually less than 1 cm

Bulla - elevated, fluid-filled lesion, usually greater than 1 cm

Clinical Pearl

A good dermatology exam requires a well lit room and sometimes a hand held light. Sometimes, you may need a ruler and magnifiying glass. Remember that sometimes the palpation of skin lesions can be just as important as what you see.

Applying What We Learned

Based on the above image, here's how we'd describe this skin lesion:

Primary morphology -> plaque,

Size -> a few centimeters

Well-Demarcated

Color -> Dully red

Secondary morphology -> Dry serum/crusting, erosions and scaling

Distribution -> Extensor surface of leg

Diagnosis is consistent with psoriasis given the above description.
